PCB Assembly
============

Assemble Components
-------------------

1. Solder the 2x 15 pin-headers to the underside of the Arduino Nano Every.
2. Solder the 3-pin header to the underside of the 5V regulator.

Solder Headers
--------------

**Note:** All components should be on the top of the PCB (where the "Ball & Plate" text is), i.e. all soldering is done on the bottom of the PCB.

1. From the 40-pin female header, cut two 15-pin headers using a stanley knife.
2. Solder the 15-pin female headers to U1 on the PCB.
3. Solder the 1x3-pin female header to U4.
4. Solder the 1x6-Pin right angle female header to U3. Note that the label for U3 appears on the bottom, but the header should still be on the top like the others.
5. From the 1x40-Pin Male Header, cut one 1x2-pin male header, three 1x3-pin male headers and one 1x4-pin male header.
6. Solder the three 1x3-pin male headers to M1, M2 and M3.
7. Solder the 1x4-pin male header to J1.
7. Solder the 1x2-pin male header to SW1.

Solder Discrete Components
-----------------------

1. Solder the DC power jack to DC1.
2. Solder the 1000uF/25V capacitor to C1.
3. Solder a 180 ohm resistor to R1.
4. Solder a 1k ohm resistor to R2.
5. Solder a 2k ohm resistor to R3.
6. Solder the LED to LED1, making sure to solder it in the right direction.
7. Solder the Shotky diode to D1, making sure to solder it in the right direction.

Attach Components
-----------------

1. Plug the Arduino Nano Every into the U1 header.
2. Plug the 5V regulator into the U4 header. Make sure to plug it in the right way around.
3. Plug the HC-05 Bluetooth module into the U3 header.

Attach to Base
--------------

1. Use the 2-56 screws to attach the PCB to the under-side of the wooden base.
