Manufactured Components
=======================

Some of the components must be manfuactured.

Ball and Plate Controller PCB
-----------------------------

I designed a [custom PCB for the controller](https://oshwlab.com/nclement/ball-and-plate-controller). This PCB can be ordered from JLCPCB. The minimum order is 5, so I still have a few left over. If you're in the Newcastle area, let me know and I'll give you one of my spares.

Base Template
-------------

Print the [base template](../CADv2/BasePlate.pdf) on a sheet of A4 paper.

Touch Panel Frame
-----------------

I designed a frame to hold the touch panel in place and attach to the servo arms. Arrange for the following parts to be 3D printed in PLA.

* [Panel Top.stl](../CADv2/Panel+Top.stl)
* [Panel Border.stl](../CADv2/Panel+Border.stl)
* [Underside.stl](../CADv2/Underside.stl)

You might want to wait until you have the touch panel so you can check the measurements.
